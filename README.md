   This app can run on a "normal" computer with enough RAM. We recommend a computer with the following specs: 8+ GB of RAM and 4+ CPU cores with 3.3+ GHz/core 
### Software Requirements
   HTPmod is developed in R. A [Shiny Server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/) is required to run this app. It has been tested on Windows (with RStudio), Mac OS (with RStudio) and Linux (with Shiny Server) systems. Please see [this](https://github.com/htpmod/HTPmod-shinyApp/wiki/Install) for installation on a Linux-based web server (it will take for 1-2 hours).
